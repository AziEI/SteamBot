	1.refactor SqlHelper in order to do it as 
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10460207/how-to-close-sqlite-connection-without-explicitly-calling-close-method-using-ne
	post says. I must use "using SQLiteConnection cn = new SQLiteConnection(GetConnectionString())".
	It allows me to not care about opening and closing db.
	2. Continue working on PutOnSell module. For now I can fetch Bot's inventory, and I need to find a neat way to understand, what I can sell and
	what I can't. somehow compare it to GetTrades method.

	Done:

	1. Done even in more neat way. I don't need to use "using" statement every time I want to call SQLiteConnection. I wrapped it into my methods,
	so every time I call "Select" or "Update", "using" statement done inside them. So for me, as a user, changed nothing - I call same methods with same
	parameters, but the method's changed itself. Encapsulation! :)
	2.

	1. Didn't want to do the PutOnSell module, decided to work on adding to SQL software. Also I've worked with 1C this day, so didn't done much.
